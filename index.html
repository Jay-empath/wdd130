        <p>Hello! My name is Ikporo Progress and I am from Nigeria, lagos. I've always been passionate about computers
            and technology since i was young. I'm thrilled to be studying web design and developmet through BYU Idaho
            education system, which a friend from The Church of jesus Christ of latter-days Saints introduced me to. I
            joined the church in December 2024, and i'm really enjoying the process of becoming a professional web
            designer and developer.</p>
